In this project, it is required to detect the plagiarism in a specific pattern from a given document, through different approaches. 
The input will be a determined number of patterns, with existing documents which can include some sentences from the pattern or not. 
The project can execute the following tasks: detecting the plagiarized patterns, highlighting the documents that the plagiarism takes 
place from, and calculating the plagiarism percentage of the pattern from each document and the total percentage of plagiarism. 

The project is executing its function using four different algorithms to compare between the time complexity of each algorithm and choose the better one. 
The projectâ€™s performance is determined by the accuracy of the plagiarism percentage detected on a specific pattern on each document besides the total percentage.
